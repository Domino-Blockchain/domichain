There are a number of initiatives that may help operators get started or grow their delegation.  All of these initiatives are completely optional.  All Domichain clusters are permissionless and an operator can join at any time.


## Domichain Foundation Delegation Program

The Domichain Foundation helps facilitate the growth of the consensus validator network by running a DOMI delegation program. The program is open to new applicants. You can find out more information [here](https://solana.org/delegation-program)

## Tour De Sun 22

Delegation program participants who operate a performant testnet node, may also join Tour De Sun 22 (TdS22).  The program gives locked DOMI incentive payments to operators for running approved hardware on Testnet. For more information, see [TdS22](https://solana.org/tds22).

## Domichain Foundation Server Program

Separately from the delegation program, The Domichain Foundation offers a server program that provides servers in various data-centers all over the world. If you would like to run a consensus validator or RPC node, you may use this program to rent bare metal servers in various data-centers. The servers meet or exceed the [Domichain validator hardware specs](../../running-validator/validator-reqs#hardware-recommendations). No long-term lease commitments are required. To find out more, visit the [Domichain server program page](https://solana.org/server-program).

## Stake Pools

The Domichain ecosystem operates various stake pools.  These stake pools delegate stake to validators using various delegation strategies. To learn more about stake pools and their delegation strategies, visit the [Domichain Foundation stake pools page](https://solana.org/stake-pools).
